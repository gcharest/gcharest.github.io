The reason I created this site is that I've produced a lot of content over the last few years and I'm now trying to bring it all together in a more central location.

I currently have two main areas of interest: Open Source Software and Type 1 Diabetes.

The first topic, free software, has been of interest to me for many years. I recently had the privilege of being the Senior Advisor on Open Source Software Adoption for the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.
This role required me to work with departments, the private sector and citizens to help develop requirements and guidelines on the use, contribution and publication of open source software in the Government of Canada.
It has been an incredible experience and I am truly impressed with all the work done by the entire community!

The second topic, type 1 diabetes, is somewhat new to me and is related to the fact that my oldest son developed type 1 diabetes in November 2018.
Then, my second son, aged 4 and a half years old, was diagnosed with the same diagnosis almost exactly one year to the day in November 2019.
This opened my eyes to a reality that was previously foreign to me and I think it made me a better person, more aware of the challenges that people face every day.

I developed tools and gathered information left and right to make life as easy as possible for us.
This is a personal project to help me manage the changes that came with my sons' diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.
There are many reliable resources (and some less...) available on the web, but I have found that they are sometimes not very accessible or are only available in English.
So my goal is to bring those that are available together in a format that is easy to use for everyone on a daily basis and to create new ones to fill in the gaps we encounter on our journey.

I would like to make it clear, however, that I am not a health specialist.

>I have no medical or health science background.
>The information gathered here comes from sources that I consider reliable but I encourage anyone interested in type 1 diabetes to consult their medical team before following the information found on my site.

On the other hand, I am a technology professional and turning to technology is a reassuring reflex in this personal and family transition.
This site is created in the open and automatically generated based on the content living in this [repository](https://github.com/gcharest/gcharest.github.io)!

I will also keep a list of free software projects that seem interesting, especially around diabetes management.
I have already gathered some of these and they all seem to be designed to log information rather than facilitate proactive planning, especially in terms of diet management in conjunction with patient treatment.

## My journey

I am an information technology (IT) professional who has worked for the government for over 10 years as well as for small businesses and non-profit organizations.
Since the very beginning, I have shared my enthusiasm for free software with my various teams and customers.
