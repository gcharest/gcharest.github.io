As I mentioned in the home page, I designed this site to bring together my work on open source software and other useful information for the management of type 1 diabetes in order to make it quickly usable.
There are many reliable resources available on the web but I found that they were sometimes not very accessible or that they were only available in English.
My goal is to bring it all together in a format that is easy for everyone to use on a daily basis.

I will also keep a list of free software projects that seem interesting, especially around diabetes management.
I have already gathered some of these and they all seem to be designed to save information rather than facilitate proactive planning, especially in terms of diet management in conjunction with patient treatment.
There may be an opportunity to engage the community in improving this dimension.

## My journey

I am an information technology (IT) professional who has worked for the government for over 10 years as well as for small businesses and non-profit organizations.
Since the very beginning, I have shared my enthusiasm for free software with my various teams and customers.
