In the table below, I have put together carb factors for various food that I have found consulting sources I trust online or that I have calculated from recipes we are doing at home.

Some of the content of the table comes from external sources and as such, are under their respective sources' copyright.
When that is the case, the source will be identified in the table.

>**Attention**: The glycemic factors found below for recipes that I calculated are approximative and may vary based on quantities used.
They are offered without any guarantee of exactitude.
See the page [Calculating a recipe's carb factor]({{site.baseurl}}/calculating-glycemic-factor.html) for more information on the method used to obtain the factor values.
All other glycemic factors have their source identified as well for you to validate.
