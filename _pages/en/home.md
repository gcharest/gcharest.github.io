Welcome to my personal website!
The reason I'm putting this site together is that I realize I've been creating a lot of content over the last few years and I really need to tidy it up in one central location.

I currently have two main areas of interest: Open Source Software and Diabetes Type 1, which turn out to not be mutually exclusive when you dive a bit into the subjects.

The first topic, Open Source Software, has been of interest to me for many years, all the way back in university.
I also recently had the honor to be the Lead of Open Source Software for the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.
For that role, I had to work with departments, private sector and citizens alike to help come up with policy requirements and guidelines on the use, contribution and publication of Open Source Software.
It was an amazing time and I am really impressed by all the work done by the entire community!

The second topic, Diabetes Type 1, is somewhat new to me and is related to the fact my son has developed diabetes type 1 in November 2018.
(Note: Since starting this site, my second son aged 4 and a half year old has also been diagnosed with diabetes type 1, a year after almost day for day, in November 2019)
It has opened my eyes to a reality that was foreign to me and I think it has made me a better person, more aware of the challenges people have to live through every day.

I have developed tools and collected information left and right.
It is a personal project to help me manage the changes that have occurred with my son's diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.
And I would like to point out that I am not a health specialist.

Besides, a note:

>I have no medical or health science training.
>The information collected here comes from sources I consider reliable, but I encourage anyone interested in type 1 diabetes to consult their medical team before following the information found on my site.

On the other hand, I am a technology professional and turning to technology is a reassuring reflex in this family transition.

This site is created in the open and automatically generated based on the content living in this [repository](https://github.com/gcharest/gcharest.github.io)!

I also started writing [blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog-posts.html) on various topics to share my findings upon researching literature, reading books or simply discovering things that may be of interest to me.

Please feel free to jump in the [Issues](https://github.com/gcharest/gcharest.github.io/issues) and start exchanging with me!
