Welcome to my personal website!

I have put together various resources and I'm also writing blog posts when I find the time, both mostly around open source software and diabetes type 1.
For more details, head over to the About page.

One of the most useful tool I have put together for myself is the carb factor table where I put together various food carb factor from different data sources to make life easier for people living with diabetes type 1.

If you have questions, you found mistakes or simply if you would like to get in touch, please feel free to jump in the [Issues](https://github.com/gcharest/gcharest.github.io/issues) and start chatting with me!
