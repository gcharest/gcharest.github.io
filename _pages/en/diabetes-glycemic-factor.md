In the table below, I have put together glycemic factors for various food that I have found consulting sources I trust online or that I have calculated from recipes we are doing at home.

>**Attention**: The glycemic factors found below for recipes that I calculated are approximative and may vary based on quantities used.
They are offered without any guarantee of exactitude.
See the page [Calculating a recipe's glycemic factor]({{site.baseurl}}/calculating-glycemic-factor.html) for more information on the method used to obtain the factor values.
All other glycemic factors have their source identified as well for you to validate.
